# Zig - Project Euler

My attempt at learning the basics of [Zig] by solving some problems on [Project Euler]

## Prerequisites

[Install Zig] (tested on Windows with version 0.13.0-dev.46+3648d7df1 at the time of writing)

## Running

A single command will calculate all solutions:

```
zig build run
```

## Testing

A single command will run all tests:

```
zig build test --summary all
```
